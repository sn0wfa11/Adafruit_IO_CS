# Adafruit IO C#

A C# library and examples for use with [io.adafruit.com](https://io.adafruit.com).

The current release can be found [here.](https://github.com/sn0wfa11/Adafruit_IO_CS/releases) as a Nuget package.

**NOTE: Only HTTP is supported at this time. I am looking into adding MQTT in the future**

Simple examples are being built and will be added soon. (Data send and receive is in the examples folder.)

## Installation

Below is a link to a Stack Overflow post on including local Nuget packages. I will develop instructions directly into this readme in the future as well.
